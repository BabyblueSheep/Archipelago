# Pizza Tower

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Toppins, Treasures and level clears are now Location Checks that can send either items from different games or items from Pizza tower.

## What is the goal of Pizza Tower when randomized?

The goal is the same, destroy Pizzaface and the tower! Optionally, reviving John can be a required goal.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Each unique level exit awards a location check.
Toppins, Treasures and Boss Keys are placed into the item pool.
Any additional items that are needed to fill out the item pool with be either filler or traps.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds. Additionally, the filler item will be a super taunt charge, and the traps can be the following:
* `Stun Trap` damages the player
* `Timer Trap` reduces the time during Pizza Time.
* `Transformation Trap` gives the player a random transformation from this list: `Ball` `Knight` `Firebutt` `Firemouth` `Ghost` `Mort` `Weenie Mount` `Barrel` `Rocket` `Sticky Cheese` `Boxed`.

## What does another world's item look like in Pizza Tower?

If the item is a Pizza Tower item from any player, it will look like its respective sprite. Otherwise, it'll resemble the Archipelago logo.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

If the item is a Toppin, Boss Key or Treasure the player will immediately get it. If the item is a filler or trap, the game will wait until the player will be affected by the item.
