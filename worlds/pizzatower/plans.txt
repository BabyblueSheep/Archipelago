Level complete
Level complete with secrets
Level complete with treasure but not secrets*
S rank
*Would it be possible to enforce Lap 2 Treasure only? That would be an interesting alternative challenge rule. 



Could also trigger a death link when you hit one of the "Hurt Peppino" milestones
Deathlink support spawns Pizza Face




MAYBE do something about dmas



Maybe there could be checks for Lap 2 completion. I'm sure some people would want P ranks as checks, but this could be a nice middle ground option?
Might also be nice to have an option to spawn at the John Pillar when you enter the level (maybe hold a button while entering?) so you can try again for lap 2 if need be


add "buffers" for traps and junk so that it cant be lost
automatically give points if you got toppins/treasures from another level/game so that a p rank is obtainable?
